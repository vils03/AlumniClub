# 1. Condition
To create a web application that allows registration of graduates and recruiters. The purpose of the app is to bring FMI graduate students together by allowing them to add events that are visible to peers in their class and major.
The other role the app supports is recruiters who have the option to view all events as well as add events. In addition, recruiters have the functionality to add job postings that are visible to all members of the FMI Alumni Club.

## 2.3. Non-functional requirements

- The system to guarantee security of users' data.

- The system uses a modular architecture for easy maintenance and updating.
- The system must be able to restore normal operation within 15 minutes of any failure or crash.
- The system has an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, with access to each functionality in up to 4 clicks from the home page with login and registration options and up to 2 clicks after logging in to the system.
- The system should allow the page to load in no more than 2 seconds under standard network traffic conditions.
- The system must have an uptime of at least 99.9%

## 2.4. Benefits of project implementation - from the point of view of users who are graduate students, the biggest benefit is that the existence of the system keeps them connected with colleagues after graduation. By adding and attending different events, they can continue to exchange experiences and ideas. On the other hand, through the ads added by recruiters, they can find out what the demand is in the market or find a job if they don't already have one.
For recruiters, the benefits are that they have the opportunity to present the companies they work for and the available positions in them to a group of people who have interests in the specific field. Thus, the search for quality personnel becomes more efficient.

# 3. Theory â€“ analysis and design of the solution 
## 3.1. Database 
- table 'Users' - contains the key information for each user, extended by the tables 'Graduate' and 'Recruiter', which contain information about the specific user roles. The connection in the database is made by Foreign key from user id to the specific role id, and in the code it is represented by inheritance.
- A 'Major' table containing the name of a user's major. The entries in the table have been added in advance to limit the majors to those in FMI.
- Table 'AdInfo' - contains information about ads added by a recruiter
- Table 'EventInfo' - contains event information
- Table 'UserToEvent' - a cross table that contains the id of a user and an event, as well as boolean variables that keep whether the event was created by the specific user or received by him
